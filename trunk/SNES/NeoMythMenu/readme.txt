Needs snes-sdk to build (http://code.google.com/p/snes-sdk/)

You'll also need to replace the lib directory that comes with snes-sdk with the ones
found at the neo-myth-menu repository (http://code.google.com/p/neo-myth-menu/source/checkout),
since the default libraries are compiled with a LOROM header, while the Neo Myth menu uses a HIROM header.
